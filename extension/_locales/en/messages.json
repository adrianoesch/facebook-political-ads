    "message": "<h2>May we have your consent?</h2> <p> ProPublica believes in providing transparency about what we do. So before you agree to this download, please take a minute to understand what the extension will do. </p> <h2>What the Extension Does</h2> <p> The extension places content script on every Facebook page you visit. That script scans for ads, which it then stores on your computer. </p> <h2>How You Can Help</h2> <p> Whenever you feel like supporting our mission, you can click on the ProPublica icon on your browser bar and a pop-up window will appear. It will contain all the ads saved on your computer. You can “teach” the Extension by classifying the ads as either Political or Not Political. </p> <h2>Information We Will Receive</h2> <p> Our server will receive clean, identifier-free html of the ads, the ads’ Facebook identifiers and demographic targeting parameters (e.g., people ages 18 and over residing in the US), their classification (Political or Non Political), and your browser’s language setting. We have otherwise made every effort to ensure the extension will not collect data that could be used to identify you individually. </p> <h2>What We Will Do With the Information</h2> <p> We will feed the information to our algorithm to help it learn to identify political ads. Once it has had enough training, we will be able to send you ads you have not already seen. When you want to know what ads others are seeing, you can click on the “Ads I’m not Seeing” icon on your browser and we will send a batch of about 100 ads. The extension will then compare those to the ads stored locally on your computer and show you only new ads. We will never receive information about what ads you have or have not seen.</p>",
