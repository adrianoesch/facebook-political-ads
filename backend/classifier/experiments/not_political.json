It seems like everyone and their brother is offering digital marketing.  You'd think everyone must be rolling in it. I spoke with over 1600 digital marketers, and only 1 in 25 are pulling in more than 10k a month. And to make matters worse, most are working 60 hours a week or more. What is supposed to be a nirvana has turned out to be no better than a job. Maybe Santa Claus does not exist. ... The average person who wants to throw their hat in the ring has a snowball's chance in hell of making it. Everyone has more experience than you and will do it cheaper than you. With that reality what chance do you have of building a business and beating the odds? What if their greatest strength was their weakness? Knowing how to do digital marketing and getting clients are not the same things. Most people focus too much on learning how to do the work and not enough on how to build a \"Business\" around it. Their oversight is your opportunity. Right now there is a glut of talented marketers that don't know how to get clients. They know how to get results once they have one, they just cant get them. If you can get clients, you can easily hand off work at a profit. That's exactly what I teach regular people to do. The cool thing about this model, is you are building using evergreen skills. You never have to worry about the rug getting pulled out from underneath you. What are those skills? Mangement, Sales, and psychology. These skills are timeless and allow you to bring people and processes together for profit. If you want to build a digital marketing business without being a digital marketing expert, I have a free training I put together for you. You can't win by doing the same things everyone else does. If you are looking for an unfair advantage, this is like taking a tank into the dark ages.
