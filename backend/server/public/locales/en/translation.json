In order to shine a light on political advertising on Facebook, <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/help-us-monitor-political-ads-online\">ProPublica built a tool</a> that allows Facebook users to automatically send us the political ads that were displayed on their News Feeds. (If you’d like to contribute ads, please download our software for <a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/facebook-ad-collector/\">Firefox</a> or <a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/facebook-political-ad-col/enliecaalhkhhihcmnbjfmmjkljlcinl\">Chrome</a> web browsers.) Use this tool to view the Facebook political ads we’ve collected so far.</p>",
